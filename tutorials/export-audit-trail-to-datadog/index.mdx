This guide will help you exporting audit trail events to DataDog. For that, it will depends on building a [custom OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/) that will collect Audit Trail events through the [Audit Trail receiver](https://github.com/scaleway/opentelemetry-collector-scaleway/tree/main/receiver/scwaudittrail) and export them with the [DataDog exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/datadogexporter).

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- An [SSH key](/organizations-and-projects/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
- An [Instance](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/)

## Building the collector

The first step is to install the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder by following [this link](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/#step-1---install-the-builder).

Once you have the `ocb` binary, you will create the manifest in YAML to configure the builder. Create a file `builder-config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
dist:
  name: otelcol-audit-trail
  description: OpenTelemetry Collector for Audit Trail
  output_path: ./otelcol-audit-trail

exporters:
  - gomod:
      github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/exporter/datadogexporter v0.118.0

processors:
  - gomod:
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/processor/batchprocessor v0.118.0

receivers:
  - gomod:
      github.com/scaleway/opentelemetry-collector-scaleway/receiver/scwaudittrail v0.1.0

providers:
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/envprovider v1.24.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/fileprovider v1.24.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/httpprovider v1.24.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/httpsprovider v1.24.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/yamlprovider v1.24.0
```

Then you can build the collector by running the following command. We specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` because the target deployment is linux with an AMD64 CPU.

```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./ocb --config builder-config.yaml
```

You will have a new folder named `otelcol-audit-trail/` with the binary compiled inside named `otelcol-audit-trail`.

## Deploying the collector

The next thing to do is to upload the collector binary to your instance:

```
scp otelcol-audit-trail/otelcol-audit-trail root@<IP ADDRESS>:/usr/local/bin/
```

The remaining of the tutoial will happen inside the instance, you need to ssh to it.

```
ssh root@<IP ADDRESS>
```

## Configure the collector

The custom collector we just build needs a configuration to run. Create the file `/etc/opentelemetry-collector/config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
receivers:
  scwaudittrail:
    access_key: <SCW_ACCESS_KEY>
    secret_key: <SCW_SECRET_KEY>
    organization_id: <SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID>
    region: <SCW_DEFAULT_REGION>

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_max_size: 1000
    send_batch_size: 100
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  datadog:
    idle_conn_timeout: 10s
    api:
      key: <DD_API_KEY>
      site: <DD_SITE>

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [scwaudittrail]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog]
```

Be sure to replace the following variables:
- SCW_ACCESS_KEY: Scaleway API access key
- SCW_SECRET_KEY: Scaleway API secret key
- SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID: Scaleway organization ID
- SCW_DEFAULT_REGION: Scaleway region
- DD_API_KEY: DataDog API key
- DD_SITE: DataDog site (see documentation in [DataDog site](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site))

## Running the collector

Create the systemd service that will run the collector by creating the file `/etc/systemd/system/opentelemetry-collector.service` with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=OpenTelemetry Collector
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/otelcol-audit-trail --config /etc/opentelemetry-collector/config.yaml
Type=simple

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Run the following command to update systemd services:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then you can enable and start the service by running:

```
systemctl enable opentelemetry-collector.service
systemctl start opentelemetry-collector.service
```

You can ensure the service is running with the command:

```
systemctl status opentelemetry-collector.service
```

And you can follow the logs with the command

```
journalctl -fu opentelemetry-collector.service
```

To confirm that the collector is polling Audit Trail events you should see something like this in the logs:

```

```
